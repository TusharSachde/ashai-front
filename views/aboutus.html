                            <p>Power for One was created to make it amazingly easy & transparent for people to support causes that they care about. The origins of the idea goes back to when the founders were schoolmates & used to volunteer with NGOs they supported- they found that a lot of NGOs had amazing ideas & projects to make the world a better place- but lacked the regular working capital to see those projects executed successfully and in a sustainable manner.</p>
                           
                            <p>After a lot of research & number ofconversations later, we also found that a large number of us as individuals want to help causes that we care about but we simply donâ€™t know where to start.</p>
                           
                            <p>Thus Power for One was born-We help people support causes that they care about by creating an ecosystem that links Donors, NGOs, Brands & Corporates.</p>
                           
                            <p>We promise to create innovative solutions that are based around our values of making charitable giving.</p>
