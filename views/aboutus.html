                            <p>Power for One was created to make it amazingly Convenient & Transparent for people to support causes that they care about.  The origins of the idea goes back to when the founders were schoolmates & used to volunteer with NGOs they supported- they found that a lot of NGOs had amazing ideas & projects to make the world a better place- but lacked the working capital to see those projects executed successfully and in a sustainable manner.</p>

                            <p>After a lot of research & a number of conversations later, we also found that a large number of us as individuals want to help causes that we care about but we simply donâ€™t know where to start.</p>

                            <p>Thus Power for One was born- We help people support causes that they care about by creating an ecosystem that connects Non Profits, Corporates & You. </p>

                            <p>Everything we do as an organization will be to make charitable giving.</p>
