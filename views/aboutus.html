The great part is that if everyone of us puts in just a little bit, we can make a real impact and change the way the world works. To me, Power for One is about creating that change. It&rsquo;s about getting people involved, it&rsquo;s about making companies responsible and it&rsquo;s about helping NGOs become efficient. In my spare time, you&rsquo;ll find me watching a Liverpool game or reading historical fiction.&nbsp;</p>
